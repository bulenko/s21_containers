# s21_containers
s21_containers  is an implementation of the s21_containers.h. library. It's my school project.

My own library that implements the basic standard C++ container classes: `list`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack`, `vector`, `array`, `multiset`.

- The program is developed in C++ language of C++17 standard using gcc compiler
- Classes is implemented as a template
- Full coverage of container classes methods with unit-tests using the GTest library
